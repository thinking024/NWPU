# 自我介绍（2-3min即可）

Good morning, dear professors. It’s my great honor here for this interview. Now I would like to introduce myself to you.

My name is Zhu Yiyuan, 21 years old and I come from Hengyang, Hunan Province. I am a senior student in Hunan University of Science and Techonology and my major is Sorfware Engineering. 

During my college years, I have been studying hard, getting excellent scores in most subjects and my gpa is 3.48. So I win school scholarships each year. In addition to basic computer courses like Data Structure, I also learned some advanced subjects, such as Data Mining and Big Data, which helps me have a better understanding on leading research.

I love computer science and programing, and have a strong hands-on ability. I always maintain great curiosity and enthusiasm for all kinds of new knowlege. Besides, I often learn extra expertise from online education websites like MOOC and Coursera. Github is also frequently used during my study.

I am open-minded, quick in thought. In my spare time, I have broad interests like many other youngers. I like reading books, especially those about  Chinese traditional poems and history.

**To Do**对于未来学习和研究的展望和看法

That’s all about me, I would appreciate it if you could give me a chance to study in Northwestern Polytechnical University.Thank you.



# 介绍家乡

My hometown is Hengyang, which is located in the south of Hunan Province. Hengyang has beautiful scenery, rich products, and many traditional food. And Hengyang plays a significant role in Hunan, because it’s an important economic and transportation hub.

As a member of the Five Great Mountains in China, Mount Heng is the most famous scenic spot there in Hengyang. It attracts many tourists from home and abroad to visit every year.

I grew up in Hengyang with my family and studied here until university. I have left many good memories here. Although this city has some shortcomings and is far less developed than big cities like Beijing, I still love my hometown.

There are several reasons. 

I have been deeply impressed by the academic atmosphere  when I came here last summer. In my opinion, as one of the most famous university in China, NWPU provide people with  enough room to get further enrichment . This is the first reason. 

The second one is I am long for doing research in  software engineering throughout my life. Its a pleasure to be with my  favorite major for lifetime. I suppose this is the most  important factor in my decision. 

Thirdly, I learnt a lot during the past  four years in my undergraduate school. However, I think further study is still urgent  for me to realize self-value. Life is precious. It is  necessary to seize any chance for self-development,  especially in this competitive modern world. In a word, I am looking forward to making a solid foundation for future profession after three-year study here.
