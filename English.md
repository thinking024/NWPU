# 自我介绍（2-3min即可）

Good morning, dear professors. It’s my great honor here for this interview. Now I would like to introduce myself to you.

My name is Zhu Yiyuan, 21 years old and I come from Hengyang, Hunan Province. I am a senior student in Hunan University of Science and Techonology and my major is Sorfware Engineering. 

During my college years, I have been studying hard and getting excellent scores in most subjects. So I win school scholarships each year. In addition to basic computer courses like Data Structure, I also learned some advanced subjects, such as Data Mining and Big Data, which helps me have a better understanding on leading research. Besides, I often learn extra expertise from online education websites like MOOC and Coursera.

I love computer science and programing, and have a strong hands-on ability. I always maintain great curiosity and enthusiasm for all kinds of new knowlege. I am open-minded and quick in thought. Since childhood, I have always been a person who likes to explore the unknown. I always like to ask why. In the process of raising questions, I often get a deeper understanding than others.

In my spare time, I have broad interests like many other youngers. I love reading books, especially those about  Chinese traditional poems and history. Badminton is my favorite sport.

NWPU has always been my dream school, and I have worked hard for it for a long time. Thus I can have this opportunity to stand in front of you and take this exam today. I would appreciate it if you could give me a chance to study in this school.

That’s all about me, Thank you.



# 介绍家乡

My hometown is Hengyang, which is located in the south of Hunan Province. Hengyang has beautiful scenery, rich products, and traditional food. And it plays a significant role in Hunan, because it’s an important economic and transportation hub.

As a member of the Five Great Mountains in China, Mount Heng is the most famous scenic spot in Hengyang. It attracts many tourists from home and abroad to visit there every year. When it freezes in winter, Mount Heng is more beautiful than any time of year. Actually, Mount Heng is only a fraction of this wonderful city that awaits you. What I’ve told you is not even half of what I see.

I grew up in Hengyang with my family and studied there until university. I have left many good memories here. Although this city has some shortcomings and is far less developed than big cities like Beijing, I still love my hometown.



# 优缺点

My strengths are as follows.

1. Patient and responsible, and  good at communicating with others. 

2. Strong adaptability and hands-on ability, able to learn and apply new knowledge quickly.
3. I always maintain great curiosity and enthusiasm for all kinds of new knowlege.
4. Besides, I also have strong self-discipline which can help me regulate the time of study and entertainment well.



My shortcomings are as follows.

1. Lack of healthy living habits. Sometimes I may stay up late. I seldom eat fruit and vegetables, and I don’t exercise often.
2. I am a little careless, and sometimes may overlook some details, espacially in some exams.
3. I am a bit of perfectionist. I always like to make everything perfect, but this often makes me very tired.



# 个人爱好

In my spare time, I have broad interests like many other youngers. 

Although I am an engineering student, reading is an essential part of my life. I really like reading books, especially those about Chinese traditional poems and history. Novels describing social life are the most books I have ever read.

In addtion, I do some exercise sometimes. Badminton is my favorite sport and I have been playing badminton since I was in middle school. When I'm short on time, I'll go to the playground for a short run.



# 介绍家庭

In my family, there are three members, my farther, my  mother, and I. 

My father is a worker, and he is always fully occupied, so most of the housework is done by my mother. 

Of course, when I am at home, I would help her. I love my parents and they love me,  too. 

When I make a success, they are more excited than me, and support me to do better. 

During my preparation for graduate examination, the support from my family is always my momentum.  

Parents’ love is unselfish, I am deeply affected, so I will  do all what I can to repay them.



# 本科学校

I studied as an undergraduate in Hunan University of Science and Technology which is located in Xiangtan, the hometown of Chairman Mao. 

In the past three years, many things have left a deep impression on me. 

The beautiful campus, excellent and responsible teachers, the delicious food in the snack street outside the school.

After the new principal took office, reforms were made in many aspects, and the school is getting better and better.

Although it is not well known, I still appreciate it because it offers me a chance to  develop my ability and brings me a lot of good memories. It makes me who I am now.



# 为什么考研

There are several reasons. 

I have been deeply impressed by the academic atmosphere in NWPU. In my opinion, as one of the most famous universities in China, it provides people with enough room to get further enrichment. This is the first reason. 

The second one is I am long for doing research in  software engineering throughout my life. Its a pleasure to be with my  favorite major for lifetime. I suppose this is the most  important factor in my decision. 

Thirdly, I learnt a lot during the past  four years in my undergraduate school. However, I think further study is still urgent  for me to realize self-value. Life is precious. It is  necessary to seize any chance for self-development,  especially in this competitive modern world. In a word, I am looking forward to making a solid foundation for future profession after three-year study in NWPU.



# 为什么选择NWPU

Firstly, I have been deeply impressed by the strong and pragmatic academic atmosphere in NWPU. In my opinion, as one of the most famous universities in China, it provides people with enough room to get further enrichment.

Besides,  computer science and software engineering disciplines of NWPU are in a leading position in China, and there are many excellent teachers with strong academic ability and responsibility.

As a student who aims to make achivements in academia, I am looking forward to a broad and splendid stage. NWPU is my best choice.



# 学过哪些计算机课程 What courses did you take?

As a software engineering student, I took many common computer courses like data structure, operating system and database. In addition, I also learned some advanced subjects, such as Data Mining and Big Data, which helps me have a better understanding on leading research.

Amoung these courses, my favorite is Data Structure. On the one hand, the teacher is very responsible and taught me well. So my interest was arisoused fully. Another important reason is that I learned a lot in this course, including many basic algorithms which are often used in computer science.



# 研究生期间的计划

There must be many things  to learn if I were enrolled into my ideal research field.

If I am luckily admitted, I will try my best to finish all the courses as planned.

At the same time I will start reading papers and doing some academic research with the seniors and my supervisor.

And then, I’ll finish my graduation thesis, take part in internships,and prepare for my future employment.

I am dreaming of the  participation of some relevant projects of my major, for this reason, I will get more experience in practice.

I believe my post-graduation life would be enriched and meaningful in NWPU.



# 读研期间面临的挑战

There may be many challenges.
But I think the hardest thing is scientific research. 

In order to solve it, I need to understand professional knowledge, and then I need to put forward innovation.
There will be many problems during this period, but I won't be afraid. 

In face of challenges, I will actively communicate with my supervisor and ask for suggestions. 
At the same time, I will also communicate with senior students to learn experience.
Focusing on what i'm interested in, I don't feel afraid and bored.



# 是否读博

Well, I thought about it. But both  my family and I haven't a complete concept of doctor(Ph.D). 
When I was in college, I didn't know the requirements of doctor's scientific research level, English ability and comprehensive quality.

Therefore, I want to gradually understand the daily life of scientific research and improve my comprehensive quality during my postgraduate period.

If I meet the requirements of a doctor in the future, I will consider about it.
