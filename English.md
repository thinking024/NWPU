# 自我介绍（2-3min即可）

Good morning, dear professors. It’s my great honor here for this interview. Now I would like to introduce myself to you.

My name is Zhu Yiyuan, 21 years old and I come from Hengyang, Hunan Province. I am a senior student in Hunan University of Science and Techonology and my major is Sorfware Engineering. 

During my college years, I have been studying hard, getting excellent scores in most subjects and my gpa is 3.48. So I win school scholarships each year. In addition to basic computer courses like Data Structure, I also learned some advanced subjects, such as Data Mining and Big Data, which helps me have a better understanding on leading research.

I love computer science and programing, and have a strong hands-on ability. I always maintain great curiosity and enthusiasm for all kinds of new knowlege. Besides, I often learn extra expertise from online education websites like MOOC and Coursera. Github is also frequently used during my study.

Since childhood, I have always been a person who likes to explore the unknown and pursue true knowledge. I always like to ask why, ask myself and ask others. In the process of raising questions, I can improve my understanding of the problems and often get a deeper understanding than others.I am open-minded, quick in thought. In my spare time, I have broad interests like many other youngers. I like reading books, especially those about  Chinese traditional poems and history.

It is  necessary to seize any chance for self-development,  especially in this competitive modern world.
