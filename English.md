In addition to basic computer courses like Data Structure, I also learned some advanced subjects, such as Data Mining and Big Data, which can help me have a better understanding on leading research. Besides, I often learn extra expertise from online education websites like MOOC and Coursera.

I love computer science and programing, and have a strong hands-on ability. I always maintain great curiosity and enthusiasm for all kinds of new knowlege. I am open-minded and quick in thought. Since childhood, I have always been a person who likes to explore the unknown. I always like to ask why. In the process of raising questions, I often get a deeper understanding than others.

In my spare time, I have broad interests like many other youngers. I love reading books, especially those about  Chinese traditional poems and history. Badminton is my favorite sport.

NWPU has always been my dream school, and I have worked hard for it for a long time. Thus I can have this opportunity to stand in front of you and take this exam today. I would appreciate it if you could give me a chance to study in this school.

That’s all, thank you.



# 介绍家乡

My hometown is Hengyang, which is located in the south of Hunan Province. Hengyang has beautiful scenery, rich products, and traditional food. And it plays a significant role in Hunan, because it’s an important economic and transportation hub.

As a member of the Five Great Mountains in China, Mount Heng is the most famous scenic spot in Hengyang. It attracts many tourists from home and abroad to visit there every year. When it freezes in winter, Mount Heng is more beautiful than any time of year. Actually, Mount Heng is only a fraction of this wonderful city that awaits you. What I’ve told you is not even half of what I see.

I grew up in Hengyang with my family and studied there until university. I have left many good memories here. Although this city has some shortcomings and is far less developed than big cities like Beijing, I still love my hometown.

In my spare time, I have broad interests like many other youngers. 

Although I am an engineering student, reading is an essential part of my life. I really like reading books, especially those about Chinese traditional poems and history. Novels describing social life are the most books I have ever read.

In addtion, I do some exercise sometimes. Badminton is my favorite sport and I have been playing badminton since I was in middle school. When I'm short on time, I'll go to the playground for a short run.



# 介绍家庭

In my family, there are three members, my farther, my mother, and I.

My father is a worker, and he is always fully occupied, so most of the housework is done by my mother. 

Of course, when I am at home, I will help her. I love my parents and they love me,  too. 

When I make a success, they are more excited than me, and support me to do better next time. 

During my preparation for graduate examination, the support from my family is always my momentum.  

Parents’ love is unselfish, I am deeply affected, so I will do all what I can to repay them.



# 本科学校

I studied as a senior student in Hunan University of Science and Technology which is located in Xiangtan, the hometown of Chairman Mao. And my major is software engineering.

I spent three wonderful years here, from freshman to senior year, everything is still vivid in my mind.

During the past years, many things have left deep impression on me. 

The beautiful campus, excellent and responsible teachers, the delicious food in the school.

After the new principal took office, reforms were made in many aspects. Teachers and students can enjoy many convenient services now. The school is becoming better and better.

Looking back on my college years, I have no regrets. Although my school is not well known, I’m still very grateful to it because it offers me a chance to develop my ability and brings me a lot of good memories. It makes me who I am now.



# 为什么考研

There are several reasons. 

The first one is that I am long for doing research in software engineering throughout my life. It’s a pleasure to be with my favorite major for lifetime. I suppose this is the most important factor in my decision. 

In addition, I learnt a lot during the past four years in my undergraduate school. However, my ability still needs to be improved, and I also want to broaden my horizon. There are still many unknown areas with great research value in software engineering that are worth exploring.

Life is precious. I think further study is still urgent  for me to realize self-value.  It is necessary to seize any chance for self-development,  especially in this competitive modern world.

In a word, I am looking forward to making a solid foundation for future profession after three-year study in NWPU.



# 为什么选择NWPU

Firstly, I’m deeply impressed by the strong academic atmosphere in NWPU. There are many excellent teachers with strong academic ability and responsibility. The Software Engineering discipline at this school is in a leading position in China, and it makes a large number of outstanding academic achievements every year. I suppose this is the most important factor in my decision. 

Besides, in my opinion, as one of the most famous universities in China, it provides people with enough room to get further enrichment. As a student who aims to make achivements in software engineering, I am looking forward to a broad and splendid stage. NWPU is my best choice.



# 学过哪些计算机课程 What courses did you take?

As a software engineering student, I took many basic computer courses like data structure, operating system and database. In addition, I also learned some advanced subjects, such as Data Mining and Big Data, which can help me have a better understanding on leading research.

Amoung these courses, my favorite is Data Structure. The first reason is that the teacher is very responsible and taught me well. So my interest was arisoused fully. Another important reason is that I learned a lot in this course, including many basic algorithms which are often used in computer science.



# 研究生期间的计划

There must be many things to do if I were enrolled into my ideal research field.

If I am luckily admitted, I will try my best to finish all the courses as planned.

At the same time I will start reading papers and doing some academic research with the seniors and my supervisor.

Then, I’ll finish my graduation thesis, take part in internships, and prepare for my future employment.

I am dreaming of the participation of some relevant projects of my major, for this reason, I will get more experience in practice.

In a word, I’m firmly convinced that my postgraduate life will be enriched and meaningful in NWPU.



# 读研期间面临的挑战

There may be many challenges in my postgraduate life. For example, how to adapt to postgraduate life quickly, how to get along well with my supervisor and how to deal with peer pressure.
But I think the hardest is scientific research.

In order to solve this problem, I need to have a good understanding on professional knowledge, and then I need to put forward innovation. There will be many problems during this period, but I won't be afraid.

In face of challenges, I will actively communicate with my supervisor and ask for suggestions. At the same time, I will also communicate with senior students to get some experience.

Focusing on what I'm interested in, I won’t feel afraid or bored.



# 是否读博

Well, I have already thought about it. But both my parents and I don’t have a complete concept of a doctor degree. Frankly speaking, I haven’t make any preparation for it.
After all, I’m still a senior student and I don’t know the requirements for a doctor degree, like scientific research level, English ability or comprehensive quality. Pursuing a PhD is serious , so I have to be cautious and think twice. 

Therefore, I want to gradually adapt to the daily life of scientific research and improve my academic ability during my postgraduate period.

If I meet the requirements for a doctor degree in the future, I will take it into consideration.
