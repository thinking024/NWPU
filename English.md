# 自我介绍（2-3min即可）

Good morning, dear professors. It’s my great honor here for this interview. Now I would like to introduce myself to you.

My name is Zhu Yiyuan, 21 years old and I come from Hengyang, Hunan Province. I am a senior student in Hunan University of Science and Techonology and my major is Sorfware Engineering. 

During my college years, I have been studying hard, getting excellent scores in most subjects and my gpa is 3.48. So I win school scholarships each year. In addition to basic computer courses like Data Structure, I also learned some advanced subjects, such as Data Mining and Big Data, which helps me have a better understanding on leading research.

I love computer science and programing, and have a strong hands-on ability. I always maintain great curiosity and enthusiasm for all kinds of new knowlege. Besides, I often learn extra expertise from online education websites like MOOC and Coursera. Github is also frequently used during my study.

Apart from my good performance in my courses, I also took part in many academic programs and competitions.

My English reading and writing skills are good, and I can speak English fluently, which is very helpful for my scientific research.  During college years, I won the first prize in the National College English Contest and passed CET-6 and spoken English test sucessfully.

That’s all about me, I would appreciate it if you could give me a chance to study in Northwestern Polytechnical University.Thank you.
